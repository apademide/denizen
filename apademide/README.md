# Content of this folder

## `config.dsc`

As the name implies, it is the config of `APADEMIDE CORE`. You can modify its values to match your best preferences.
You should not remove keys and sometimes update it to be sure they are all present. You may miss some features otherwise.
The config file is checked on `APADEMIDE CORE` reload. If some config options are missing, you'll be noticed in the console. 

## `CORE`

The `CORE` folder is where the internal scripts of `APADEMIDE CORE` are stored.
Do not modify the scripts inside of it! By modifying them, you're more likely going to break things in unsuspected ways.

If you want to add features, use `MODULES`!

## `MODULES`

The `MODULES` folder is where `MODULES` are stored. You are free to download this folder partially or entirely, or to not download it at all. It contains some default modules that aren't necessarily useful but are nice as working exemples.

This is also where you can add your own `MODULES`. To see the documentation about `MODULES` and how to create them, go to the [Wiki section](../../../wiki).
