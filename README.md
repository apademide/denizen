# `APADEMIDE CORE`

## Background
`APADEMIDE CORE` is a set of scripts that provide many useful features for Denizen Scripters.

For you to appreciate this document and `APADEMIDE CORE` globally, you must already be familiar with Denizen and scripting.
If there's already terms you didn't understand at this point, it means that's most likely not the case.   
[Discover what Denizen is here](https://guide.denizenscript.com/guides/background/what-is-denizen), or [join the Discord server](https://discord.gg/Q6pZGSR)!

## Getting started
To use `APADEMIDE CORE`, you must add the content inside [`/apademide`](../../tree/main/apademide) into your Denizen's `script` folder on you server and reload. If you didn't change the config script, `OKAY! APADEMIDE CORE is now activated.` should appear in the console.

If something wrong prevented `APADEMIDE CORE` from being enabled, some debug info should appear to help you determine why.

As soon as it's enabled, you can start using its features and add new modules.

## Documentation & support

The documentation about how to use `APADEMIDE CORE` and what features it provides is available in this [repo's Wiki](../../wiki).
