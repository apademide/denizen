# `APADEMIDE CORE`

## Background

`APADEMIDE CORE` is a set of scripts that provide many useful features for Denizen Scripters.

For you to appreciate this document and `APADEMIDE CORE` globally, you must already be familiar with Denizen and scripting.
If there's already terms you didn't understand at this point, it means that's most likely not the case.   
[Discover what Denizen is here](https://guide.denizenscript.com/guides/background/what-is-denizen), or [join the Discord server](https://discord.gg/Q6pZGSR)!

## Getting started

To use `APADEMIDE CORE`, you must add the content inside [`/apademide`](../../tree/main/apademide) into your Denizen's `script` folder on your server and reload. If you want only the `CORE` without `MODULES`, do not add the [`MODULES` folder](../../tree/main/apademide/modules).

If you didn't change the config script, `OKAY! APADEMIDE CORE is now activated.` should appear in the console.
If something went wrong and prevented `APADEMIDE CORE` from being enabled, some debug info should appear to help you determine what and why.

As soon as it's enabled, you can start using its features and add new modules.

To configure some main features and functionnalities of the `CORE`, you can edit its `config.dsc` file.
The config's documentation is directly inside the file.

## Documentation & support

The documentation about how to use `APADEMIDE CORE` and what features it provides is available in this [repo's Wiki](../../wiki).
Details about config options are directly available in the config file.

To get more help and support, you can ask me (`apademide#8240`) in a thread in `#denizen` on the [Denizen discord](https://discord.gg/Q6pZGSR).
